# Guess The Color!
It was a challange I saw in WebDevCody's video and wanted to try.
I used Vite to see the difference from my usual framework, Next.js

## How to Play?
You need to guess HEX color code of the color of the block at the center of the page.
Every right answer 1 point
One wrong answer and you lose your progress
Enjoy!
